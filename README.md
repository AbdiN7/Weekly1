# Weekly1


[Goal]
A Simple LMS that allows users to create add books to their virtual library, can be used to keep track of books you wish to have. Great for those who (like me) tend to forget to keep track of such things.



[Getting Started]
The program can be ran in a code-editor/IDE of your choice.
Clone the repo, paste in a location of your choice, and run.

After Starting the program you will be introduced to a menu in the console asking you to enter a sub menu.



[Features]

 --This program is will have a small footprint overall on the user's computer
 
 --Follows the linux philosophy "Do one thing and Do it well / store data in small flat text file"
 
 --Because of it's light-weight it is also extreamly fast. moves as fast as you can type.
 
 --Organized neatly, objects names are readble, relatively scaleable
